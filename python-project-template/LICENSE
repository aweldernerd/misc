                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.

 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it. By contrast, our General Public
 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 all versions of a programâ€”to make sure it remains free software
 for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
 General Public License for most of our software; it applies also
 to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply
 it to your programs, too.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price. Our General Public License is designed to make sure that
 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
 charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source
 code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
 software and use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you
 know you can do these things.

 To make sure that everyone understands that this is what we
 mean by free software, we have written this license. It is
 important to make sure that everyone else also understands that
 they have these freedoms.

                             TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

 "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

 "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
 kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

 "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
 this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees"
 and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

 To "modify" a work means to copy it or adapt it in any way
 requiring permission under copyright law, including the
 preparation of derivative works.

 "You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of
 the rights granted or affirmed under this License. You are not
 allowed to impose any further restrictions on the exercise of
 the rights granted under this License.

 1. Source Code.

 The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the
 work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any
 non-source form of a work.

 A "Standard Interface" means an interface that is standard in
 the sense of having been widely used and accepted by the
 community.

 2. Basic Permissions.

 You are permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of
 the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
 provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
 each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
 warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
 and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients
 of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
 for a fee.

 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

 No covered work shall be deemed to be a derivative work of
 another covered work. The work shall not be considered a
 derivative work of another work merely because it is
 incorporated into a larger work.

 4. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

 You may convey a modified version of the Program under the
 terms of section 2, provided that you also meet all of these
 conditions:

 a) The modified work must itself be licensed under this License,
 and you must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
 and to the absence of any warranty.

 b) You must cause the modified work to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the work and the date of any change.

 c) You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
 and to the absence of any warranty.

 d) You must provide a copy of this License along with the
 modified work.

 5. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the
 terms of sections 2 and 4, provided that you also do one of the
 following:

 a) Convey the object code form in, or embodied in, a physical
 product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied
 by the corresponding source code on a durable physical medium
 customarily used for software interchange.

 b) Convey the object code form via a network, along with a
 copy of the corresponding source code. 

 6. Additional Terms.

 You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of
 the rights granted or affirmed under this License. You are not
 allowed to impose any further restrictions on the exercise of
 the rights granted under this License.

 7. Termination.

 If you fail to comply with this License, then your rights
 under this License terminate automatically. However, if you
 have not received a notice of violation from the Licensor, you
 may continue to exercise your rights under this License
 provided that you cure the violation within 30 days of
 receiving notice of the violation.

 8. Future Versions.

 The Free Software Foundation may publish new versions of the
 GNU General Public License from time to time. Each version is
 given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
 that a certain numbered version of this License "or any later
 version" applies to it, you have the option of following the
 terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any
 later version published by the Free Software Foundation.

 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

 You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
 run a copy of the Program. An individual who makes a modified
 version of the Program and distributes it is not required to
 accept this License for the modified version, provided that he or
 she does not distribute the modified version.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 receives a license from the original licensors to run, modify and
 distribute that work, subject to this License.

 11. No Warranty.

 There is no warranty for the Program, and the Licensor is not
 liable for any damages resulting from the use of the Program.

 12. Limitation of Liability.

 In no event shall the Licensor be liable for any damages arising
 from the use of the Program.

 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

 If you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to
 make it free software that everyone can redistribute and change
 under these terms.

 To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is
 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to
 most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file
 should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where
 the full notice is found.

 <one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.>
 Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

 This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
 (at your option) any later version.

 This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
 GNU General Public License for more details.

 You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
 along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

/**
 * Diagnoses whether a car has a failed wheel bearing.
 *
 * This process involves the following steps:
 * 1. Listen for unusual noises: Drive the car at various speeds and listen for humming, grinding, or growling noises that increase with speed or change when turning.
 * 2. Check for wheel play: With the car safely lifted, grasp the wheel at the 12 and 6 o'clock positions and attempt to rock it. Excessive play
 * 3. Inspect for uneven tire wear: Examine the tires for abnormal or uneven wear patterns, which can be a symptom of a failing wheel bearing.
 * 4. Feel for vibration: While driving, note any unusual vibrations or wobbling sensations coming from the wheels.
 * 5. Check for ABS warning lights: Some vehicles may trigger an ABS warning if a wheel bearing with an integrated sensor fails.
 * 6. Confirm by rotating the wheel: Spin the wheel by hand (when lifted) and listen for grinding or roughness, which can indicate bearing failure.
 *
 * If any of these symptoms are present, further inspection or replacement of the wheel bearing may be necessary.
